MXKeyboard: A Compact 3x3 Matrix Keyboard Project

This project contains the necessary files to build a compact 3x3 matrix keyboard using an Arduino Pro Micro. The files include KiCad footprints and symbols for various key switches and microcontrollers.

The keyboard is designed to be simple yet functional, making it perfect for small-scale applications or as a starting point for more complex keyboard designs. Please note that this project does not include firmware."
